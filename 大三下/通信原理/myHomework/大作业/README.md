# Principles of Communication-Project

## Environment Preparation
1. This project is totally implemented by MATLAB R2019b, so an available MATLAB should be installed in advance.

## Introduction for Files and Functions
1. A general introduction for the files in this folder is as follows:
    | file | Intro |
    | ------ | ------ |
    | `figures` | result and design screenshots of the tasks |
    | `src` | source code files of the tasks |
    | `3190102060_project.pdf` | soft copy of the project report |
2. The introductions for the functions and programs in `src/` folder is as follows:
    | file | Intro |
    | ------ | ------ |
    | `Task_0.m` | simulate the SER performance of the Minimum Distance Detector and also draw the corresponding decision region |
    | `Task_1/visual_decision_region.m` | visulize the decision region of the Optimal Detector according to constellation and a priori probability|
    | `Task_1/Task_1.m` | a call to `Task_1/visual_decision_region.m` to visualize the Optimal Detector's decision region for Constellation (0) |
    | `Task_2.m` | simulate the SER performance of the Optimal Detector and also compare it with the results of the Minimum Distance Detector |
    | `Task_3.m` | simulate the BER performance of the best bit mapping scheme and also compare it with the results of a random labeling scheme |

## Running Methods
1. All the main files can run directly by MATLAB. Just open the file using MATLAB and run the code.
